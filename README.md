# Hello-World-

I origanlly started in IT network and System Admin after highschool. 
I was always interested in tech as a kid.
I  always had a passion for coding but never took the chance to start learning. 
As i grew older and look to switch industries starting 03/20/2020 MM/DD/YYYY
I am hopeful i will complete my Goal before the end of 2021.
