# Hello-World-
My first Repository.

I origanlly started in IT network and System Admin after highschool. 
I was always interested in tech as a kid.
I  always had a passion for coding but never took the chance to start learning. 
as i grew older and look to switch industries i am hopeful i will complete my goal.
